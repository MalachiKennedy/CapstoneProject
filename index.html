        <h2>Housing</h2>
        <p>Housing plays a crucial role in shaping the social, economic, and cultural fabric of communities in Queens. The borough, known for its diverse population and neighborhoods, faces significant housing challenges that deeply impact its residents. Some neighborhoods in Queens face issues like high rents, low rental vacancies, and expensive construction. In March 2024, the New York City Council declared a housing emergency to extend the Rent Stabilization Law to April 1, 2027. However, half of all households in New York are still rent-burdened, meaning they spend more than 30% of their income on rent.</p> 
        <br>  SOME CAUSES OF HOUSING ISSUES:
          <ul>
            <li>Increased rent/Evictions</li>
            <li>Gentrification</li>
            <li>Immigration</li>
          </ul>

        <h2>Sanitation</h2>
        <p>Sanitation is a fundamental aspect of community health and well-being, and its impact is particularly significant in densely populated and diverse areas like Queens. Proper sanitation services—including waste management, street cleaning, and sewage systems—are essential for maintaining a clean and healthy environment. District Manager James McClelland says Primary issues in terms of sanitation include dumping,” he said. “We do have a litter basket pickup two times a day, but it seems a lot of people are throwing household trash on the corner, so it’s very difficult to keep up with”.</p>
        <br>  SOME CAUSES OF SANITATION ISSUES:
        <ul>
          <li>Dozens of trash piling up</li>
          <li>Garbage trucks not coming on time</li>
          <li>Illegal dumping</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Transportation</h2>
        <p>Transportation plays a pivotal role in shaping the daily lives, economic opportunities, and overall well-being of communities in Queens. As a large and diverse borough with a mix of urban and suburban areas, Queens faces unique transportation challenges that affect its residents in various ways. State Assembly Member Alicia Hyndman stated, “Queens is the most diverse borough in NYC and one of the city’s largest transit deserts. Lack of access to public transportation not only harms communities but derails lives. With congestion pricing aggressively approaching, express bus service into Manhattan is more crucial now than ever. We must be prepared for the pending impact of more express bus riders post June 30. Though the current MTA bus network has recents wins, transportation wins to one borough and not all boroughs; is a loss. It is unacceptable for Queens residents to be excluded from express bus improvements."</p>
        <br> SOME CAUSES OF TRANSPORTATION ISSUES:
        <ul>
          <li>A lot traffic caused by construction</li>
          <li>Commercial areas generate large number of trucks causing more traffic</li>
          <li>Limited train stations</li>
        </ul>
